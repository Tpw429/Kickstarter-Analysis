# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this Excel assignment was to determine and predict how Louise's play "Fever" compared in its fundraising goal in respect to different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. To determine these results, creating pivot charts and tables were essential to understand the complete picture.

# Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge I had during this assignment was trying to determine what variables I wanted to use to create my pivot tables. At times, I wanted to add more data than was required. I also had a few issues with the UNIX Timestamps, but eventually figured out how to display the correct time and eventually convert it into hours. To understand how target amount and month of fundraising impacted how successful the campaign would be, I had to use pivot tables. Pivot tables are extremely powerful, because they allow me to pull and altar certain types of data and create efficient "Pivot Charts". One thing I didn't realize was that "Pivot Charts" allow you to put text in the x-axis, while other charts do not have this same function in excel.

# Results
## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Time of year really does impact the success of a campaign. According to our data, the months of "May" and "June" have the highest chance of meeting their fundraising goal, while months like November, December, and January (the colder months in America and Europe) all have a much lower chance of meeting their goal.
2) The summer months, like May, June, and July all seem to have higher chances for success rates on meeting their funraising goal. One thing I do notice in the dataset, is that the number of data points during these months is much higher too (more events go on during these months). I wonder if the lack of data outside of the summer months can skew the data slightly.

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude companies that shoot for over $45,000 in fundraising or more statistically have a much lower chance of meeting their goal than those with goals of less than amount.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
In this dataset, we did not exclude outliers. The data could have been trimmed to give us a cleaner final result. In addition, the higher the target goal number went the less data we had. The data across all the fields was not equal in terms of the number of runs we had in each column.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For ease of visualization, we could have included a Box and Whiskers Plot like we did in the Modules. This is a great visual which helps us detect outliers to the dataset. I think it could have been very useful in trimming some of the outlier data.
